Wi-PER81 is a pioneering dataset and benchmark for Wi-Fi-based person re-identification (Re-ID). It provides a complete pipeline from raw Channel State Information (CSI) signal processing to deep learning benchmarking using image-based radio signatures.

---

## 🔍 Overview

Wi-Fi sensing enables privacy-preserving alternatives to camera-based Re-ID by exploiting the amplitude characteristics of wireless signals. Wi-PER81 captures CSI data from **81 individuals** across **two acquisition sessions**, amounting to **162,000 packets**. This dataset supports deep learning models trained on **signal magnitude heatmaps** for person Re-ID in realistic, noisy environments.

## 📁 Repository Structure

This repo contains three core Jupyter notebooks:

### 1. `WiPER-DataProcessing.ipynb`
Processes raw CSI to generate sanitized amplitude values:
- Builds CSI matrices from raw data.
- Applies Hampel, Z-score, and **IQR filtering** (recommended).
- Visualizes raw and sanitized amplitude values and heatmaps for the specified ID.

### 2. `WiPER-DatasetGeneration.ipynb`
Generates image-based datasets:
- Splits data into training (D1), validation (D2v), and test (D2t) sets.
- Converts sanitized amplitudes into **signal magnitude heatmaps**.
- Organizes probe/gallery pairs for benchmarking.

### 3. `WiPER-Benchmarking.ipynb`
Benchmarks deep learning models:
- Implements a **Siamese-like neural architecture** for person Re-ID.
- Trains and tests multiple CNN backbones described in the WiPER81 paper.
- Computes standard Re-ID metrics (e.g., Rank-1, Rank-5, Rank-10, mAP).
- Contains the snippet code to reproduce the paper’s results using the provided pre-trained models.

> 🧪 To reproduce these results, use the **final code snippet in `WiPER-Benchmarking.ipynb`**, skipping the training and performance evaluation cells. This snippet loads the pre-trained weights from the `pre-trained` folder and evaluates the models directly on the provided test set located at `output/ImageData/D2t/` (modify the path if needed).
